What's in this mod?

- An online store! Accessed by a special implant, you can send packages of raw material to them to gain currency, which you can in turn use to buy their products.
- Cute uniforms! Maids, nuns, school uniforms, underwear, stockings, etc.
- Transforming weapons! High-end weapons that can bring melee fighting on par with the advanced fusion/laser weapons some mods introduce.
- Three new starts! (Maid, nun, schoolgirl)

Nearly all items use the "cute" or "AMTS" prefix to make them easily identifiable from base game or other mods' items.

Installation:

This mod is designed for use with the Chesthole sound pack. You must manually copy the sound files into the proper directory to have compatible sounds.
