Installation:

This mod is designed for use with the Chesthole sound pack. You must manually copy the sound files into the proper directory to have compatible sounds.

What's in this mod?
- Cute uniforms! Maids, nuns, school uniforms, underwear, stockings, etc.
- Transforming weapons! High-end weapons that can bring melee fighting on par with the advanced fusion/laser weapons some mods introduce.
- A remote-access store! Accessed remotely via special teleporter device, you can send packages of raw material to them to gain currency, which you can in turn use to buy their products.
- Three new starts! (Maid, nun, schoolgirl)

Nearly all items use the "cute" prefix to make them easily identifiable from base game or other mods' items.
